# Argo floats recovery

Increasing floats recovery is a recurrent discussion item among the Argo community. This repository is a place holder for the activities of the working group on #argofloats recovery initiated during the [1st Arvor/Provor technical workshop]() that was held in Brest in 2020.

The working group ongoing goal is to discuss and to provide recommendations on:
- how to modify Argo floats to make them easily recoverable
- security issues in recovering and handling used Argo floats
- tools needed to promote and making possible floats recovery
